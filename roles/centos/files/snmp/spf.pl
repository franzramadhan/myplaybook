# Description: Perl based AgentX server to send data back to the 
# cacti server and nagios server. Originally this was just a bash
# script which was called from a sh/exec directive in the snmpd.conf
# but that feature has been deprecated because of a lack of adherence 
# snmp standards. Oh well, perl/C let's one work around it with a
# module :-)
